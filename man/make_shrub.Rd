\usage{
make_shrub(canopy, size = 1, distance = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{canopy}{\code{SpatRaster} object showing canopy attributes for area of
interest, made with \code{make_canopy}. CRS must use meters as linear unit.}

\item{size}{minimum size, in acres, a shrubby area must occupy for inclusion}

\item{distance}{maximum distance, in feet, two shrub polygons can be from
one-another and still count as a single shrubby area}
}
\value{
\code{sf} object containing polygons of shrub/young forest areas
that meet the minimum size threshold, with an \code{acres} column.
